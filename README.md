# master-thesis

My master thesis proposes a feedback-system for hate-speech-classification, which uses XAI-methods to make the AI-process more transparent and explainable. The prototype can be deployed as Django project. The code for this Django project is in this repository.

Model training and data preparation was done in Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o0zfHF2WewV9BucNImBJ8LusXtPLxtL3?usp=sharing
